# qb-streetfight

This was forked from  https://github.com/JGCdev/xex_streetfight it is an ESX boxing script in which I converted to QBCore. All props go to JGCDev. All I did was convert. Enjoy!

This use with this YMAP https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-ymap-fightclub/805634

## WHAT TO DO

All you do is start the script, add the YMAP unless you change locations within the config and it should be good to go.
